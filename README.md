Product Overview 
============

1. Social Login 
============

Social login reduces the barriers users face when attempting to register on your website by allowing them to log in with their existing social accounts, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google and <a href="http://support.loginradius.com/hc/en-us/articles/202078178-List-of-ID-providers-that-can-be-integrated-via-LoginRadius-API">30 other networks</a>. This eliminates the need to create yet another username and password.

Website owners have seen registration rates increase by as much as 63% after enabling social login.

2. Social Sharing
============

Make your users your brand ambassadors and drive high quality referrals to your website - 82% of users consider buying or trying products and services based on their friends’ recommendations. With social share, you give users the tools to share your content, product details and other information with their own networks.

More than 22 billion shares are viewed each and every day on the internet, with sharing becoming an increasingly important part of every website owner's marketing strategies.

3. User Profile Data
===========

Our solution allows websites to <a href="https://secure.loginradius.com/datapoints">collect more than 200 user data points</a> - such as demographics, name, education, verified email address and many more - in order to better understand users. This enables businesses to personalize users’ web experiences and then build long-term relationships with them.

Website owners get complete, on-demand access to users’ profile data and have full, permanent ownership of it.

4. Social Analytics
===========

With social analytics, website owners get access to far more data fields than traditional analytics - such as Google Analytics - because they include individual users' interests, gender, education, relationship status, age and also track their activities across websites.

LoginRadius can also track the amount of referral traffic your website receives and measure your company’s social reach.
