Social Login Add-on for OsCommerce portal
======
This Add-on enables social login on OsCommerce websites by letting users log in through their existing IDs such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Vkontakte and over 15 more! This eliminates the typical registration process (i.e. filling out long registration forms, verifying email addresses, remembering a new username and password) so that your users are just one click away from logging into your website. Other than social login, this plugin also provides User Profile Data and Social Analytics.
