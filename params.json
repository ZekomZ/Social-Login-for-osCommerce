This module enables Social Login, Social Sharing, User Data and Analytics on your osCommerce site.\r\n\r\nProduct Overview \r\n============\r\n\r\n1. Social Login \r\n============\r\n\r\nSocial login reduces the barriers users face when attempting to register on your website by allowing them to log in with their existing social accounts, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google and <a href=\"http://support.loginradius.com/hc/en-us/articles/202078178-List-of-ID-providers-that-can-be-integrated-via-LoginRadius-API\">30 other networks</a>. This eliminates the need to create yet another username and password.\r\n\r\nWebsite owners have seen registration rates increase by as much as 63% after enabling social login.\r\n\r\n2. Social Sharing\r\n============\r\n\r\nMake your users your brand ambassadors and drive high quality referrals to your website - 82% of users consider buying or trying products and services based on their friends’ recommendations. With social share, you give users the tools to share your content, product details and other information with their own networks.\r\n\r\nMore than 22 billion shares are viewed each and every day on the internet, with sharing becoming an increasingly important part of every website owner's marketing strategies.\r\n\r\n3. User Profile Data\r\n===========\r\n\r\nOur solution allows websites to <a href=\"https://secure.loginradius.com/datapoints\">collect more than 200 user data points</a> - such as demographics, name, education, verified email address and many more - in order to better understand users. This enables businesses to personalize users’ web experiences and then build long-term relationships with them.\r\n\r\nWebsite owners get complete, on-demand access to users’ profile data and have full, permanent ownership of it.\r\n\r\n4. Social Analytics\r\n===========\r\n\r\nWith social analytics, website owners get access to far more data fields than traditional analytics - such as Google Analytics - because they include individual users' interests, gender, education, relationship status, age and also track their activities across websites.\r\n\r\nLoginRadius can also track the amount of referral traffic your website receives and measure your company’s social reach.\r\n\r\nLive Product Demo\r\n==========\r\n\r\nhttp://demo.loginradius.com\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n=========\r\nPlease follow the link to download this social login and sharing module for osCommerce: \r\n\r\nOs-Commerce v 2.3: http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/8306\r\n\r\nOs-Commerce v 2.2: ​http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/8421\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n==========\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at support@loginradius.com​","google":"UA-22321867-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
